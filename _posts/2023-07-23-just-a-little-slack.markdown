# Just a little slack
I have a lot of hobbies, or so I'm told...  

I enjoy playing chess - although it's been awhile since I've spent any real time playing that.  I enjoy playing the guitar - this comes and goes in waves.  I love to study different subjects - although I spend less time studying Buddhism I spend about 20 minutes everyday meditating, it's how my day begins.  For the last 5 years or so I've also been learning Spanish and about 2 years ago started learning Chinese.  I also spend a good amount of time exercising also in waves but usually at least 2-3 times a week I'm either out walking or training with weights.

So, I guess that's a lot.  I had an interesting conversation about this subject with my wife last night.  Whether or not you're trying to build muscle, improve on the guitar, play chess - whatever it is, we have a tendency to compare ourselves to people who have dedicated their lives to this one thing.  I'm thinking about people like Arnold Schwarzenegger:

In different ways these are two examples of people dedicating and sacrificing their life choices to achieve their dreams.  This is an exceptional feat and you can argue that any one of us could do something similar, I think that there are few people born that have such a vision and drive of what they want to do with their lives.  

Even understanding that it doesn't stop us from comparing oursleves to these professionals - or masters even.  There is the idea that to master a skill it takes 10,000 hours of practice.  That is basically a full-time job for 5 years.  In my example, even if I average 5 hours a week of guitar time (which is very rare for me) I would be a master in about 38 years. Taking 6 months off because life gets busy with kids, work, school whatever just drags this out to about... never.  

And all of that is fine.  The problem comes in when we start thinking thoughts like, "Why am I so bad at playing guitar? I've been playing this song for months and I still can't play it right - I should be better at this" or "Why can't I run an 8 minute mile".  These are all attainable goals but it takes time and sacrifice to achieve these goals.  You can do it but it will take a plan, some dedication and some sacrifice.  We have to balance our lives... childcare, work, our lives - with what our goals are in our hobbies. 

Remember, to cut yourself some slack, be nice to yourself - you're doing your best after all.  All of us are out there doing our best trying to figure things out.  

Take Care.
